Read the following files in order:
1. CLAUDE.md
2. CLAUDE-project.md
3. CLAUDE-state.md
4. CLAUDE-roadmap.md

Do NOT read CLAUDE-decisions.md unless something in state or roadmap references
a decision that needs context — it's reference material, not session briefing.

Then give me a brief orientation:

1. **Project** — What this is, in one sentence (from CLAUDE-project.md)
2. **State** — What's broken and any open questions (from CLAUDE-state.md)
3. **Roadmap** — Current phase, what's in progress, what's up next (from CLAUDE-roadmap.md)
4. **Open threads** — Any open questions or things I was figuring out
5. **Suggested pickup** — What makes sense to work on now, based on "Next session"
   in CLAUDE-state.md plus your own judgment
6. **Health check** — Flag any contradictions between files (e.g., state says
   something is broken but roadmap shows it as done). If everything is consistent,
   say so.

If parking lot has 5+ items, mention: "You have X parking lot items — worth a
quick review?"

Keep it short. This is a briefing, not a report. If everything is early/empty,
just say so and ask me what I want to work on.
